SimpleCommentSystem 1.0.0
Copyright 2011. Ross Lagerwall

This software is released under the LGPL Version 3.

SimpleCommentSystem is an easy to use comment system that does not rely on
databases and simply uses text files to store the comments. It is easy to
implement and ensures that the comments are stripped of all html before storing
them. The html appears inside a div tag with the id of comment so any styles
that need to be applied can be applied.
